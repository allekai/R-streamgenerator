\title{Generate iteratively a list of subspaces and margins based on the initial set of subspaces with a particular volatility}
\usage{
generate.dynamic(dim, subspaces, nstep = 10, volatility = 0.1,
  values = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 0.7, 0.9), cycle = 0,
  allowOverlap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dim}{Total number of dimensions from which to generate the subspaces.}

\item{subspaces}{A list of generated subspaces.}

\item{nstep}{Number of steps for which we generate new subspaces and margin values.}

\item{volatility}{Percentage of subspaces to replace at each step.}

\item{values}{A vector of valid values for subspace margins.}

\item{cycle}{If > 0 the dynamic contains a cycle of this size.}

\item{allowOverlap}{States whether overlap between subspaces are allowed. (might be a bit more complex if TRUE.). Note that full overlap and subset relation are never allowed.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{marginlist} A list containing lists of margins for each steps
\item \code{subspacelist} A list containing lists of subspaces for each steps
}
}
\description{
Generate iteratively a list of subspaces and margins based on the initial set of subspaces with a particular volatility
}
\details{
For each step produce a new set of (possibly overlapping) subspaces where length(subspaces)*volatility subspaces were changed
and assigned a margin taken from values
}
\examples{
subspaces <- list(c(1,2,3), c(3,4), c(5,6,7,8), c(7,8,9))
meta <- generate.dynamic(dim=20, subspaces=subspaces, nstep=3, volatility=0.5)
meta_cycle <- generate.dynamic(dim=20, subspaces=subspaces, nstep=10, volatility=0.5, cycle=3)
