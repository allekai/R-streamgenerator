\title{Generate Static Data Stream}
\usage{
generate.static.stream(n = 1000, prop = 0.01, stream.config = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{A vector containing \code{x} values, where the values corresponds to the number of points for each step and \code{x} to the number of steps.}

\item{prop}{Proportion of outliers in the hidden space.}

\item{stream.config}{A stream configuration object. Should have been generated with \code{nsteps = 1}.}
}
\value{
A an object of class stream, which is a List of 5 elements.
\itemize{
\item \code{data} contains the stream generated
\item \code{labels} contains the description of each point (\code{0} if the point is not an outlier, or the subspace in which it is outlying as a string)
\item \code{n} the number of points at each step
\item \code{prop} the proportion of outliers in the hidden space
\item \code{stream.config} the associated stream configuration object (which is valid only for static streams)
}
}
\description{
Generate a new synthetic multidimensional static data stream having the desired properties.
}
\details{
The data is generated uniformly, except in certain subspaces where the data is concentrated on the axes,
in the L-like shape. This should create spaces with high dependency and space to observe hidden outliers.
Note that the proportion of outlier \code{prop} does not relate directly to the percentage of outliers
in the output stream. Since it corresponds to the probability of a point, being ALREADY in the hidden space
to stay where it is, the overall proportion of outliers depends on the hidden space volume, which depends
on the number of subspaces and their margins.

\examples{
# Generate a stream with default parameters 
stream <- generate.static.stream()
# Generate a stream with custom configuration
stream.config <- generate.stream.config(dim=50, nsteps=1) # nsteps should be = 1
stream <- generate.static.stream(n=1000, prop=0.05, stream.config=stream.config)
# Output stream results (to uncomment)
# output.stream(stream, "example")
