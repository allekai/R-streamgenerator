\title{Generate a valid stream configuration.}
\usage{
generate.stream.config(dim = 20, mindim = 2, maxdim = 4, values = c(0.1,
  0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9), nstep = 10, dependency = "Wall",
  discretize = 0, cycle = 0, volatility = 0.1, allowOverlap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dim}{Number of dimensions in the stream.}

\item{mindim}{Minimum number of dimensions for each subspaces. Should be >= 2.}

\item{maxdim}{Maximum number of dimensions for each subspaces. Should be >= mindim and <= dim/2.}

\item{values}{A vector of valid values for subspace margins.}

\item{nstep}{Number of steps for which we generate new subspaces and margin values.}

\item{dependency}{Type of dependencies available in the stream, currently either "Wall" or "Square" or "Donut" (in the future: "Mixed")}

\item{cycle}{Number of iterations to use to create a cyclic streams. If 0, then the stream has no cycle.}

\item{volatility}{Proportion of subspaces to change at any step. Should be > 0 and <= 1. 1 means that all subspaces and margins at changed a each step}

\item{allowOverlap}{States whether overlap between subspaces are allowed. (might be a bit more complex if TRUE.). Note that full overlap and subset relation are never allowed.}

\item{decretize}{whether the output should be discrete or not. 0 means it is real. Any other number of discrete possible values. (10 is the minumum)}
}
\value{
A stream.config object to be passed to a generate.dynamic.stream or generate.static.stream method
