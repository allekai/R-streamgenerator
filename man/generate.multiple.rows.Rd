\title{Helper function that generates multiple rows.}
\usage{
generate.multiple.rows(n, dim, subspaces, margins, dependency, prop,
  proptype, discretize, verbose, method = "Rejection")
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of rows to generate.}

\item{dim}{Number of dimension of the vector generate.}

\item{subspaces}{List of subspaces that contain a hidden space (i.e they
show some dependency).}

\item{margins}{List of margins that correspond to each subspace.}

\item{prop}{Probability of a point belonging to the hidden space of a
subspace to become an outlier.}

\item{proptype}{Type of the proportion of outliers. Value "proportional":
depend on the size of the empty space. Value "absolute": same absolute
proportion per subspace.}

\item{verbose}{Print the number of the current step.}

\item{method}{Defines the point generation method. "Rejection" creates points
randomly until they fit into the dependency. "Construction" creates points
that are close to the relation with respect to the margin. If proptype is
"proportional" then first a random point is generated to check, whether the
point is in the hidden space and may become an outlier. If proptype is
"absolute" the decision whether the point becomes an outlier is made piror
to its generatrion.}

\value{
A list with 2 elements where \code{data} is a data.frame object
containing the \code{n} vectors and \code{labels} containing \code{n}
corresponding labels.
}
\description{
Helper function that generates multiple rows with the same characteristics.
Useful to generate a static stream.
