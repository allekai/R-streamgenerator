\title{Random generation of consecutive subspaces}
\usage{
generate.subspaces(dim = 20, mindim = 2, maxdim = 4,
  allowOverlap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dim}{Total number of dimensions from which to generate the subspaces.}

\item{mindim}{Minimum number of dimensions for a subspace.}

\item{maxdim}{Maximum number of dimensions for a subspace.}

\item{allowOverlap}{States whether overlap between subspaces are allowed
(might be a bit more complex if TRUE). Note that full overlap and
subset relation are never allowed.}
}
\value{
A list of partly overlapping subspaces spanning over the \code{dim}
dimensions
}
\description{
Random generation of partly overlapping consecutive subspaces with a minimum
number of dimensions \code{mindim}
and a maximum number of dimensions \code{maxdim} from a total number of
dimensions \code{dim}.
}
\details{
Generate at most \code{round((dim*0.75)/length(mindim:maxdim)/x)} subspaces
of each size \code{x}.
For example, for \code{generate.subspaces(dim=100, maxdim=5, mindim=2)}:
\itemize{
\item at most 4 5-dim subspaces
\item at most 5 4-dim subspaces
\item at most 6 3-dim subspaces
\item at most 10 2-dim subspaces
This is done so to make sure that roughly a least 25% of the dimensions are
unaffected. This also make sure the dimensions are not dominated by
high-dimensional subspaces.
TODO: Can this be improved?
